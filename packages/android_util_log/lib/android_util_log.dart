/// API for sending log output.
/// 
/// Generally, you should use the [Log.v], [Log.d], [Log.i], [Log.w],
///  and [Log.e] methods to write logs. You can then view the logs in logcat.
/// 
/// The order in terms of verbosity, from least to most is 
/// [Log.error], [Log.warn], [Log.info], [Log.debug], [Log.verbose].
/// 
/// Tip: A good convention is to declare a TAG constant in your class:
/// ```dart
/// private static const TAG = "MyClass";
/// ```
/// and use that in subsequent calls to the log methods.
/// 
/// Tip: Don't forget that when you make a call like
/// ```dart
/// Log.i(TAG, "My message");
/// ```
/// 
/// that when you're building the string to pass into Log.d, 
/// the compiler uses a StringBuilder and at least three allocations occur: 
/// the StringBuilder itself, the buffer, and the String object. 
/// Realistically, there is also another buffer allocation and copy, 
/// and even more pressure on the gc. That means that if your log message 
/// is filtered out, you might be doing significant work and 
/// incurring significant overhead.
/// 
/// Note: The return value from the logging functions in this class may 
/// vary between Android releases due to changes in the logging implementation. 
/// For the methods that return an integer, 
/// a positive value may be considered as a successful invocation.
